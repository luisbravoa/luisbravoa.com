                <p>I’ll start by telling you a little bit about myself, I’m venezuelan currently living in Athlone,
                    Ireland. Working in Ericsson Software Campus in the UI SDK team developing libraries and
                    components used globally in the organization.
                </p>

                <p>I got my computer engineering degree back in 2007. Before graduating I started taking some
                    web design courses and then started developing in PHP, also I taught a PHP course in the
                    university in which I graduated. I moved to Buenos Aires about 2 years ago in search of new
                    challenges and opportunities.
                </p>

                <p>I have experience working with object oriented PHP, frameworks like zend framework and
                    cakePHP. I am Zend certified engineer PHP 5.3 License ZEND022332.I have worked with
                    databases such as Mysql, Postgresql and MSSQL.
                </p>

                <p>I have experience with javascript frameworks such as Backbone and knockout and working
                    with Google Maps and Places API.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I recently was the team leader building an application using Jquery, Jquery UI, backbone and
                    Google maps API, it was a corporate portal for a taxi company where i work that used a REST
                    API (that we also build using node.js). It included a widget for booking a taxi online for multiple
                    users at once, checking a permission system and using Google places API and Open Street
                    maps also.
                </p>

                <p>As far as my node.js, I’ve a started developing in node at the beginning of last year when I
                    started using express.js, sequelize.js, orm2, mongoose to learn and develop my own projects,
                    then when I began working in Safertaxi (a startup that consist of mobile apps for booking taxis
                    a lot like Uber). I started developing the new platform for corporate customers as the lead
                    developer of a small team. We developed an API using restify.js for the REST functionality,
                    bookshelf.js as the ORM, handled the asynchronous behaviour using promises with when.js.
                    When we finished i was asked to join the main API team that handles all of the operations and
                    serves the mobile apps. One of the things I like about working in Safertaxi is the opportunity
                    they gave me to develop and learn new technologies such as node.js and make the jump
                    from developing PHP applications to develop in node.js and using javascript in a new way not
                    only in the server side but also in the browser side.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I am a hardworking person that likes challenges, solving problems and most of all I am a
                    quick learner.

                    repos showcasing my js coding ability.
